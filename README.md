# pollicy
Version controlled crowd-sourced A/B tested debate platform

Pollicy is a new thing. An open-source search for truth; a platform for fair and balanced discussion without the noise, ego and narrative control.  Explore and update a versioned debate.  Mind-map of statements which support, oppose or rebut the moot, complete with citations! 
* All statements are explicitly tagged as positive (factual, objective, descriptive) or normative (opinion, subjective or values-based).
* Every change is committed to the repository, but must pass A/B polling to confirm it enhances the debate.  An unpopular new sentiment only needs 30% upvotes to enter the main branch, while edits require  60% or more.
* Anyone may create a new debate or even clone an existing one.  Pollicy continually scans github for new debates to list in it's explorer.
