# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  Pollicy is a new thing. An open-source search for truth; a platform for fair and balanced discussion without the noise, ego and narrative control.  Explore and update a versioned debate.  Mind-map of statements which support, oppose or rebut the moot, complete with citations! All statements are explicitly tagged as positive (factual, objective, descriptive) or normative (opinion, subjective or values-based).
  Every change is committed to the repository, but must pass A/B polling to confirm it enhances the debate.  An unpopular new sentiment only needs 30% upvotes to enter the main branch, while edits require  60% or more.
  Anyone may create a new debate or even clone an existing one.  Pollicy continually scans github for new debates to list in it's explorer.
